description: Take a screenshot and analyze it
---

Take a screenshot of my screen and analyze it. Save it as `screenshot-{timestamp}.png` in the current directory.

Use the macOS `screencapture` command with interactive selection mode (-i) so I can choose what to capture.

After taking the screenshot, read and display the image so I can see what was captured.
